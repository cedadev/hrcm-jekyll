title: 'Plot of the month (Dec 2016): land and global precipitation'

<h4><em><strong>Plot of the month</strong></em> for December 2016 is from <strong><a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/userpages/nr912752.php">Benoît Vannière</a></strong>, who evaluates hydrological cycle processes in models and their sensitivity to model horizontal resolution.<img></h4>

<p>This figure shows the<strong> ratio of land to global precipitation as a function of model resolution</strong> (at 50°N). Filled circles show atmosphere-only experiments and open circles show coupled experiments.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is interesting to note that two different behaviours arise depending on model formulation: for finite differences/volumes models (HadGEM3, CAM5-1) the land to global precipitation ratio increases with resolution, whereas it decreases in spectral models (EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3.1, MRI3.2).</li>
<li>Coupling does not modify this behaviour.</li>
<li>The purple circles stand for two experiments testing the sensitivity to the resolution of orography: the control (top) uses HadGEM3_GA6 on high-resolution N480 grid, the perturbed experiment (bottom) uses the same atmospheric resolution but with low-resolution N96 orography (see the <strong><a href="https://hrcm.ceda.ac.uk/about-us/">About HRCM</a></strong> page for an illustration).</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>This is ongoing research.</em></strong></div>
