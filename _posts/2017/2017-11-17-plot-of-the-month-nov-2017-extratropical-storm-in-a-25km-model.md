  shows how extratropical storms are represented in a high-resolution, 25 km global
  climate model.

  Following on from previous posts, the figure below shows in detail how winds and
  precipitation, particularly along the trailing front and the maximum over France,
  are represented more realistically in a 25 km global model.'
