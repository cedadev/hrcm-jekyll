<h4>Plot of the month for September 2017 shows the progress made by the modelling centres contributing atmosphere-only simulations to the <a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a> project.</h4>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Recent progress in supercomputing power has enabled climate models to simulate more processes in detail and on smaller spatial scales. In the <strong><a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a></strong> project, a coordinated set of global climate experiments has been designed to assess both standard and enhanced horizontal-resolution simulations of the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p>These simulations will provide a more reliable basis for assessing climate risks that are associated with weather phenomena, such as (extra-)tropical cyclones, and will form part of the CMIP6 model intercomparison exercise.</p>
<p>Six modelling centres are contributing and all have completed their atmosphere-only simulations driven by high-resolution historical sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and other forcings. The UK's Met Office Hadley Centre has completed an additional intermediate-resolution simulation.</p>
