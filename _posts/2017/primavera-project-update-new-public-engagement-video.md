<p>Many societally-important sectors use climate information, such as transport, energy and insurance. Engaging with these users is an integral part of the <strong><a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA project</a>, </strong>but more than this, we are inviting <em>direct user input</em> into forthcoming high-resolution global climate simulations which will be delivered during the project.</p>
<p>To kick-start this process, and raise public and user awareness of PRIMAVERA, a new <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTU7VKZHjEQ">five-minute video</a></strong> has been produced to introduce the project.</p>
