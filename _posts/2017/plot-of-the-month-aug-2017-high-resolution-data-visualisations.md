<h4>Plot of the month for August 2017 is a collection of animated visualisations of high-resolution global climate model data, created by HRCM scientists and colleagues within the <a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a> project.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Animated visualisation of global climate data - whether model output or observations - brings to life what are often termed the synoptic-scale 'building blocks' of climate. Here are a few new animated visualisations of high-resolution global model output, representing the cutting edge of global climate models. These have been compiled to showcase the models involved in the <strong><a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a></strong> project, which is a current focus of the HRCM group.</p>

<p><strong>Figure | The coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM version of EC-Earth (i.e., NEMO+LIM3 - OASIS - IFS) at "ground-breaking resolution" of <strong>T1279-</strong>ORCA12, or ~16 km in both atmosphere and ocean (courtesy of <a href="http://www.bsc.es">Barcelona Supercomputing Centre</a>). In the North Atlantic region of this simulation, the influence of cold and warm Gulf Stream ocean eddies on the 2-meter air temperature field may be seen.

<p><strong>Figure | 30-year spin-up of the Met Office coupled model HadGEM3-GC3.1 at N216-ORCA12 resolution (~60-km atmosphere and 1/12 degree ocean), completed following the HighResMIP protocol (courtesy of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=4HqmT-kAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;is_public_preview=1">Malcolm Roberts</a>). The colours show daily surface ocean current speeds, with flickering features that result from atmospheric storms passing over the ocean.
