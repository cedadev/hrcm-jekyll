<h4><strong><em>Plot of the month</em></strong> for February 2017 is provided by <a href="http://alexbakey.wordpress.com">Alexander Baker</a>, who characterises the relationship between European extreme precipitation and the North Atlantic Oscillation.</h4>

<p>The effects of atmospheric modes of variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), on the spatiotemporal distribution of European mean precipitation are relatively well-documented, but less is known about their impact on precipitation extremes. It is important to determine how well GCMs represent relationships between extremes and large-scale modes of atmospheric circulation variability, particularly for understanding the implications of a given medium-range or seasonal NAO forecast for extreme precipitation. Here, we evaluate the resolution sensitivity of European extreme precipitation (95th percentile) in gridded observations (ECA&amp;D E-OBS) and in an ensemble of atmosphere-only HadGEM3-GA3 simulations (from the <strong><a href="/research/projects/upscale/">UPSCALE project</a></strong>), in which mid-latitude horizontal resolution is increased from ~135 (N96) to ~25km (N512).</p>
<p>We computed daily NAO indices from the mean sea level pressure field, composited the 95th percentile of daily winter precipitation, and reduced this to a zonal mean field (see figure). In this example, the large-scale pattern – wet north-western Europe and dry southern Europe – is reproduced by HadGEM3-GA3. However, the response of extreme precipitation between ~40-50°N to NAO phase is overestimated across the resolution hierarchy and the variability between 58-65°N is captured only at N512 resolution, likely due to its better representation of Norwegian topography.</p>

<p>Ongoing work is extending such analyses to multiple atmosphere-only and coupled models within <strong><a href="/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a></strong> and associating extreme precipitation to phenomena whose frequency is impacted by large-scale variability, such as <strong><a href="/extratropical-storms/">extratropical cyclones</a></strong>. Overall, this work aims to develop our understanding of the implications of a given medium-range or seasonal NAO forecast for extreme precipitation across Europe.</p>
