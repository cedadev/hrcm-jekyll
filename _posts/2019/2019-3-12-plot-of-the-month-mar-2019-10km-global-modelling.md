description: 'Plot of the month for March 2019 showcases a 10km-resolution global
  simulation, performed by Pier Luigi Vidale.

  This is a still from an animation created using output from HRCM''s flagship global
  climate model, HadGEM3, run at a resolution of about 10km. The animation shows a
  typical year of simulation, with liquid and frozen water content integrated to show
  clouds; colours within clouds indicating amount of precipitation (rain and snow),
  sea ice and snow amounts shown at the surface with bright colours. Look for weather
  fronts at mid to high-latitudes, as well as tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)
  appearing in the season May to November in the Northern Hemisphere tropics: you
  should be able to spot the "eye" feature of those powerful storms.'
