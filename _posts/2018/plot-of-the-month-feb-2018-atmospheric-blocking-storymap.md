<h4>Plot of the month for February 2018 is from the <a href="https://hrcm.ceda.ac.uk/research/projects/primavera/">PRIMAVERA</a> project as part of its user engagement activities, which explores the role atmospheric blocking plays in European weather and its effect on the energy sector.</h4>
<p>Instead of the large-scale westerly flow that is typical of the North Atlantic, with the passage of low- and high-pressure systems and their associated cold and warm fronts, mid-latitude atmospheric blocking appears as large, quasi-stationary high-pressure systems (anti-cyclones). Atmospheric blocking is a stable atmospheric circulation that yields persistent weather over large regions for weeks to months.</p>
<p>Persistent dry conditions and anomalously weak winds occur below the high-pressure area. Depending on the topography and position of the blocking event, persistent rain (and potentially flooding) may occur if the unstable throughs adjacent to the high-pressure area may receive sufficient moisture (e.g., a warm water mass; for Europe, this may be the Mediterranean Sea).</p>
<p>The scientific and societal importance of these anticyclonic systems is explored by a 'storymap', which may be found <a href="https://uip.primavera-h2020.eu/storymaps/atmospheric-blockings#carouselMap" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
