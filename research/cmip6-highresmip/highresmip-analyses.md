<p>The HighResMIP protocol paper (Haarsma et al 2016) indicated several areas of process-based analysis that would be priority for coordinated analysis. Given that the data volumes are large, the more coordination on data access the better. The HighResMIP datasets will be available on the <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/">CMIP6 ESGF</a>Â data network, once that is ready to receive it. However, this would still mean downloading large data volumes to local disk.</p>
<p><br>To facilitate initial analysis, the PRIMAVERA simulation output is all available on one platform at <a href="http://www.ceda.ac.uk/projects/jasmin/">CEDA-JASMIN</a>. We have been discussing with various communities how to grant them access to these datasets. We welcome other groups getting in touch with us for similar collaboration.</p>
<h4><br>CLIVAR - PRIMAVERA</h4>
